# tournaments
TLDR; An imperfect tournament generator I wrote in Java for use at the video game convention I ran annually in high school.
I'm slowly working on making this better and better. For now, it only generates the first round of the tournaments randomly, and can only add to predetermined tournaments (granted, it only takes 3 lines of hardcoding to add a new tournament), and it's also interactive via console instead of some sort of display window, which means in order to run it, you have to compile it in Your Favorite Java Compiler (I use Eclipse Oxygen) and work through the console. It also doesn't remember entrants over multiple runs, which is something I'd like to integrate eventually.
Also also, as I said, it generates randomly. There's no way to seed it yet. I'm working on a rewrite that integrates optional seeding, but that'll take a while.
Just make sure when you put it in Your Favorite Java Compiler that you name the package "tournaments" (or rewrite the first line of code accordingly) so it, y'know, actually does stuff.
Also also also, there's a lot of notes-to-self in the comments of the code that I use to remember where I was when I last tried to work on it. I don't get all that much time to work on it so it's usually a long time between sessions.
Other than all those numerous repulsive imperfections, enjoy!
